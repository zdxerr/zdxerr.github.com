After [my bike](http://www.radon-bikes.de/xist4c/web/ZR-Team-7-0_id_18365_.htm) got stolen (locked, in broad daylight, in front of my home), I am in need of a new tranportation device. I abolished the thought of buying a new one, similar to the old and commited myself to build a [singlespeed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-speed_bicycle) using an old racing bike frame.

The additional parts that might be needed are:
- Saddle/Seatpost
- Wheels
- Tyres
- Tubes
- Handlebar
	- Stem
	- Grips
- Brakes
	- Levers
- Peadls
- Chain
- Cycle conversions 42:17, approximately a 2.5:1 ratio

The next step is to prepare the frame and find suitable components.

Let's see how that works out.
